# Crop Disease Foundation Models: A Set of Technical Articles

A single, well-documented repository that collects papers, datasets, code, pretrained models, simulation/digital-twin environments, baseline notebooks, evaluation scripts, and demo UIs — all specifically for crop disease detection, monitoring, and management (text + vision + multimodal + decision-making).

# Crop-Disease-Foundation-Models

Curated resources, code, and benchmarks for foundation-model-enabled crop disease detection, monitoring, and management.

## What this repo contains
- `papers/` — annotated list of recent studies (LLMs, VLMs, multimodal) focused on crop diseases.
- `datasets/` — links + preprocessing scripts for PlantVillage, in-field datasets, hyperspectral disease sets.
- `models/` — baseline models (classification, detection, VLMs) and pointers to weights.
- `sim/` — digital twin environments and sim-to-real experiment configs.
- `experiments/` — RL/adaptive-learning recipes and evaluation scripts.
- `notebooks/` — walkthroughs: detection → explanation → prescription report → Q&A.

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/<you>/Crop-Disease-Foundation-Models`
2. Read `datasets/readme.md` for dataset setup.
3. Launch demo: `python demos/gradio_demo.py`
